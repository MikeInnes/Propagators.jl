# Propagators

This is a Julia implementation of Radul and Sussman's propagator model, as
described in "Software Design for Flexibility". It's a fairly direct (and not
necessarily practical) port designed to run their demos, but it does try to be
Julian (eg using structs rather than closures for objects). There are some
walkthroughs in the demos folder.
